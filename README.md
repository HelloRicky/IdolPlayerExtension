# IdolPlayerExtension
A chrome extension that will change video speed depend on the content that is playing

Girls love watching dramas always want the video to be played at 2x speed at the "irrelavent" content, once the main characters appear on the screen, girls want to switch back the speed to normal and enjoy watch their idols.

This extension use the tensorflow.js to detect if the main characters is shown on the screen, once detected, speed will be set to normal, otherwise, double up playing.
